&lt;p&gt;My dear TLS,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize if this postcard arrives with all the summer ones! But the fact is, my research is about environmental education in schools, which means I collect my data &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; summer break rolls around. Here I am at the Clifford A. Phaneuf Environmental Center in Forest Park (Springfield, Massachusetts). Each year, elementary school students throughout the district come to the park to learn about environmental science. The program is called E.C.O.S., which stands for Environmental Center for Our Schools. In just a few weeks, 4th grade students arrive to learn about animal habitats and life cycles by exploring the trails, catching bugs and tadpoles, and observing animals up close. But today I am conducting surveys with the 5th grade students about their memories from last year. I want to know – after catching frogs in the pond at E.C.O.S., did students want to go out and catch frogs again with their friends and families or did they just want to catch &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatslifesci.com/2017-06-13-Biodiversity-in-my-Backyard-EKuras/&quot;&gt;Pokémon&lt;/a&gt; instead? We’ll find out soon, after I collect the surveys and crunch the numbers! In the meanwhile, I hope you’re getting out there too and experiencing as many amazing salamanders and ladybugs as possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheerio,&lt;/p&gt;

Well, arachnids, insects, and amphipods have solved this issue – you can make babies and eat your sexual partner at the same time! That’s right, sexual cannibalism is a thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sexual cannibalism is when a female animal eats a male of the same species before, during, or after copulation [1]. It’s a behavior that has caused controversy among evolutionary biologists for decades. Current evolutionary theory says that natural selection acts on animals to keep traits that increase reproductive success within a population. In other words, if a trait hurts your chances to make more babies, you probably won’t make many babies and, as a result,  that trait will gradually leave the gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first look, it doesn’t seem like sexual cannibalism helps much with reproductive success. After all, getting eaten means that you will not have any future chances to make children. Even so, sexual cannibalism must have provided some reproductive advantage in order for us to see it so commonly in arachnids, insects, and amphipods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some of the fascinating studies in spiders that explore how sexual cannibalism came to be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/136882531@N02/37792463235/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;2017-11-27-LGuoA&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4518/37792463235_60ed817d95.jpg&quot; width=&quot;298&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; alt=&quot;2017-11-27-LGuoA&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-australian-redback-spider--when-males-are-complicit-in-their-own-death&quot;&gt;1. Australian redback spider – When males are complicit in their own death&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The males of most spider species attempt to avoid being eaten by carefully approaching females and running away when copulation is over (typical commitment-phobe…), indicating they have evolved to be more cautious to survive to reproduce again [1]. However, Australian redback spiders present an extreme case of self-sacrifice, where the male spiders position themselves above the female’s jaws during copulation [2]. This act, called male complicity, seems to contradict the goal of increasing reproductive success (see Bruno Mars’ Grenade). What in the world would drive these male spiders to let themselves be eaten?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists found that male complicity in Australian redback spiders led to two paternal advantages [2]. On average, complicit males had longer copulation sessions and as a result fertilized more eggs. While female Australian redback spiders typically mate with multiple males, females that ate males were more likely to reject additional mates, suggesting that the eaten male would have less competition in fertilizing the female’s eggs. Together, these benefits may have driven male complicity to become an adaptive behavior in Australian redback spiders. Interestingly, a follow-up study showed that if a female was well-fed, she was less likely to consume her partner [3]. This suggests that in poor environmental conditions, sexual cannibalism becomes more useful for increasing male and female reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Nursery Web spider – When males bring gifts in the hopes of staying alive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Nursery Web spider, males are not so willing to sacrifice themselves. Instead, males bring the spider version of flowers and chocolate: a lovely hand-wrapped insect gift [4]. If the female moves to attack the male instead of accepting the gift, the male may play dead, entering a state called thanatosis. Despite “dying,” males manage to keep the gift poised between themselves and the female. As soon as the female begins to eat the gift, the male springs to life, initiating copulation. Researchers found that males engaging in thanatosis had more successful copulations with females. This implies thanatosis is an adaptive strategy to increase the chance that a male survives to mate again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Humped Golden Orb-weaving spider – When females just need a little extra spider in their diet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense for a female that consuming her sexual partner would increase her reproductive success. The extra nutrition can increase the number and quality of her eggs or improve the chances they will be fertilized [1]. Interestingly, not all females of a given species are cannibalistic. To determine the potential benefits of sexual cannibalism, researchers allowed female Humped Golden Orb-weaving spider to kill but intervened before they could eat their mates, preventing the females from gaining the nutritional benefits of eating their partners [5].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When comparing females that killed their mates to those that did not, they found that “killer” females were predisposed to earlier maturation, faster growth, and produced larger first egg clutches, even though they did not consume the mates they killed. However, “killer” females  females matured at a smaller size and in poorer condition than their less violent counterparts,  potentially meaning that for small “killers” eating a male would have a higher relative nutritional benefit than it would for a larger female. The researchers suggested that sexual cannibalism in this species occurs more often in females that require more meals to compensate for their poor condition and improve their reproductive output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While sexual cannibalism is a fascinating subject, there is no simple answer as to why it evolved in these taxa. Every studied species seems to have different story to tell, making it difficult to understand this bizarre phenomenon. All I can say is, I don’t envy the males of these species who walk a fine line between parenthood and death!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dearest TLS,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the most amazing experience and opportunity. This past fall, I got to attend a science conference in Malaysia! The conference was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isbca-2017.org/&quot;&gt;5th&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isbca-2017.org/&quot;&gt; International Symposium on Biological Control of Arthropods&lt;/a&gt;. This meeting only occurs every four years and group of about 200 researchers from all over the world (25 countries were represented this year!) come together to discuss their research on &lt;a href=&quot;https://biocontrol.entomology.cornell.edu/what.php&quot;&gt;biological control&lt;/a&gt; (management of pest species by the introduction of a natural enemy or predator) of destructive insects. Being able to attend this scientific meeting was not something I was expecting, but when the opportunity came my way 10 months ago by way of an email announcement from the organizing group and a follow up invitation by my Major Advisor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://eco.umass.edu/people/faculty/elkinton-joseph/?_ga=2.123590664.2012271588.1507505677-1472999311.1485274172&quot;&gt;Joe Elkinton&lt;/a&gt;, I decided right then and there that I’d make it happen. I’d travel to a professional, international conference in Malaysia to present my research and hear from other researchers who study similar topics. It would take organization, some pooling of monetary resources, and a lot of preparation for a strong presentation, but with the support of my advisor, I was dedicated to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting—The 5th International Symposium on Biological Control of Arthropods—focused on managing pest insect and other arthropod species using &lt;a href=&quot;https://biocontrol.entomology.cornell.edu/what.php&quot;&gt;biological controls&lt;/a&gt;, which is the introduction or augmentation of natural enemies (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatslifesci.com/2016-08-25-The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly-Predators-Parasitoids-and-Parasites-MDavis/&quot;&gt;predators, parasitoids, or parasites&lt;/a&gt;) to suppress a population of the pest species. It utilizes natural ecological relationships to bring balance back to a disturbed ecosystem. You may have heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.ipm.ucanr.edu/WhatIsIPM/&quot;&gt;integrated pest management&lt;/a&gt; (IPM); biological control is a component of this strategy. Unfortunately, biological control historically got a bad reputation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/blog-network/our-modern-plagues/biocontrol-more-cane-toads-and-mongooses&quot;&gt;careless introductions of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/blog-network/our-modern-plagues/biocontrol-more-cane-toads-and-mongooses&quot;&gt;generalist natural enemies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popsci.com/blog-network/our-modern-plagues/biocontrol-more-cane-toads-and-mongooses&quot;&gt;, such as cane toads and mongooses,&lt;/a&gt; to control invasive species during the late 1800s and early 1900s. However, since the 1970s or 1980s, with renewed emphasis on safe practices, it has made a comeback. It is now considered an important economic alternative to mechanical control (which is physically destroying the pest plant or animal) and a green alternative to chemical control (such as herbicides, pesticides). In order to safely use biological controls, we must first learn about how these different pests and their natural enemies function in different environments, and that’s what I’m researching as a PhD student!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel to Malaysia from Massachusetts is quite a journey, but it makes sense to attend an international meeting on biological control because this work is international by nature. Invasive insects, accidentally transported between countries, are &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatslifesci.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2017-09-07-Are-we-running-out-of-invasives-HBroadley/&quot;&gt;increasingly prevalent in our globalized world&lt;/a&gt;. One can gain considerable insight into how to manage these pest species by studying them in their native habitat and collaborating with researchers there. Also, pest insects and arthropods are an issue worldwide, so there is a lot to learn from each other on how similar pests are being managed in other countries. I aim to pursue a career studying invasive species. To do so effectively, international connections and collaborations are essential. With the goal of encouraging international networking in mind, this meeting rotates from continent to continent. The last meeting was held in Chile and the next will be in Canada in four years!  I hope I can make it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting was fantastic! I learned so much and did get to meet a global community of fellow researchers. I had conversations with scientists from New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, China, Chile, Kenya, France, Switzerland, Canada, the United States, and Malaysia, of course! I presented my work on the invasive &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatslifesci.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2017-03-27-The-hungry-caterpillar-in-real-life-HBroadley/&quot;&gt;winter moth&lt;/a&gt;, and the role of native natural enemies in controlling their spread and received excellent feedback on my work from this experienced, diverse, and top-notch group of researchers. I feel so honored to have been able to take part in this meeting and look forward to building on the connections I made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the cherry on top…I got to do a bit of traveling for fun before returning home!&lt;/p&gt;

This past fall, I got to attend a science conference in Malaysia! The conference was the 5th International Symposium on Biological Control of Arthropods. This meeting only occurs every four years and group of about 200 researchers from all over the world (25 countries were represented this year!) come together to discuss their research on biological control (management of pest species by the introduction of a natural enemy or predator) of destructive insects. Being able to attend this scientific meeting was not something I was expecting, but when the opportunity came my way 10 months ago by way of an email announcement from the organizing group and a follow up invitation by my Major Advisor, Joe Elkinton, I decided right then and there that I’d make it happen. I’d travel to a professional, international conference in Malaysia to present my research and hear from other researchers who study similar topics. It would take organization, some pooling of monetary resources, and a lot of preparation for a strong presentation, but with the support of my advisor, I was dedicated to make it happen. Figure 1. The logo for the 5th International Symposium on Biological Control of Arthropods, which took place on Langkawi Island in Malaysia. Image Credit: ISBCA 2017 The meeting—The 5th International Symposium on Biological Control of Arthropods—focused on managing pest insect and other arthropod species using biological controls, which is the introduction or augmentation of natural enemies (such as predators, parasitoids, or parasites) to suppress a population of the pest species. It utilizes natural ecological relationships to bring balance back to a disturbed ecosystem. You may have heard of integrated pest management (IPM); biological control is a component of this strategy. Unfortunately, biological control historically got a bad reputation for careless introductions of generalist natural enemies, such as cane toads and mongooses, to control invasive species during the late 1800s and early 1900s.
