**Order Araneae**

*Jumping Spiders – Family Salticidae*  
Dear crickets, you'd best circumvent,  
That spider in a little pup tent.  
With big eyes she'll track you  
Then pounce and attack you,  
You'll become a predation event!

*Net-casting Spiders – Family Deinopidae*  
A spider who's got no tapetum  
Catches bugs 'cause he's able to see ‘em  
In the dead of the night  
He perches just right  
To cast a net they just can't get free from.

**Fig. 2** A *Deinopis subrufa* net-casting spider holds its silken net-like web, waiting for prey to pass by. Also notice its large posterior median eyes, which can see in the dark even without a tapetum, a layer of reflective tissue located behind the retina of many other spider species.

*Fishing Spider – Family Pisauridae, Genus Dolomedes*

A spider who sits on a lake  
Sits still though she's wide awake.  
For her main dish  
She'll have tadpoles or fish  
'Cause she feels the vibrations they make.

**Fig. 3** A six-spotted fishing spider (Dolomedes triton) uses surface tension and water-repellent hairs on its body to stand on the surface of a body of water.

**Order Amblypygi**

A fellow who's out rather late  
Walks on six legs though he's got eight.  
One pair is like whips  
With hairs at the tips.   
They wiggle and investigate.  

**Order Opiliones**

Spindly legs on the jungle floor walking,  
Harvestmen can drop one and keep stalking.  
But with a body so modest  
The bit that's the oddest?  
The size of his penis is shocking.

**Fig. 4** Profile of a male *Phalangium cornutum* harvestman, where the eye and ocular tubercle are indicated by *a,* and the mandible is indicated by *b.* The penis (indicated by *e* in the diagram), its sheath (*d*) and glans (*f*) are not present in other arachnids. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvestman_anatomy#/media/File:Britannica_Harvester.png))

**Order Scorpiones**

Though her tail may deliver a sting,  
Watch how she holds her offspring:  
Once her babies appear,  
They survive on her rear.  
She's like, killing this motherhood thing.
