Dearest TLS,

Forget going outside--I spent a summer day in the most magical place on earth, a.k.a. a museum basement full of mammal bones! I was there to collect data for a research project looking at whether animals with horns and antlers (sheep, goats, antelopes, deer, and friends) have specially shaped neck vertebrae to help them 1) hold up that fancy headgear and 2) hit competitors in the face with it during the mating season. I spent my day in the museum twirling through specimen cabinets like Belle in the Beast’s enormous library, pulling out drawers full of amazing bones and skulls and taking them to my measurement station.

**Fig. 2** Amazing diversity of antelope horns, skulls, and jaws! Did I need these specimens for my research? No. Did I waste 15 minutes checking out all the different horn shapes? You know it! (Image by Abby Vander Linden; specimen copyright Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University)

While I had a list of mammal bones I needed to measure for my project, I spent half my time distracted by other fascinating skulls and horns (some of them over 100 years old) that I just had to pick up and look at. Oh, and I constantly talked to the specimens as I handled them, like an actual mad scientist. The biodiversity in these cabinets is breathtaking, and I can’t wait to go back for to collect more data. If you get a chance to visit a museum collection behind-the-scenes, you absolutely should!

With love + bones,

Abby

**Fig. 3** My new plan to get rich quick in grad school is to design football helmets that look like musk ox skulls. Check out that protective horn growth over the top of the head! I’m sure my helmets will be shockingly popular with both players and fans. (Image by Abby Vander Linden; specimen copyright Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University)
