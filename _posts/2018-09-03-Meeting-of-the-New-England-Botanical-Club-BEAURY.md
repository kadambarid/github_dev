Dear TLS, 

Greetings from the summer meeting of the New England Botanical Club! Forays, field trips, talks (and food) took over my weekend as expert botanists gathered to explore the Pioneer Valley's plant life. We’re all familiar with the green-up following spring, but from a botanist’s point of view, the magic comes when you take a closer look.

Fog swept over the valley on June 1st as the NEBC's weekend began. I joined a group scaling the damp hillsides of Mount Toby on the hunt for flowers.

On the second day of the meeting, the group spread across Western Massachusetts for a variety of field trips and workshops. I found myself with a group of botanists exploring the Montague Sandplains- a hidden habitat of sandy soils deposited from a melting glacier thousands of years ago. 

**Figure 7** The dry microclimate of the sandplains requires controlled burning to prevent natural wildfires. Burning aids nutrient cycling in the sandplains to host vegetation. *Pinus rigida* and *Quercus* spp. are dominant here.

**Figure 10** Did you know plants can rust? This discoloration is caused by a fungal disease.

We found some rare orchids under the canopy of the sandplains, and some wildlife as well!

**Figure 11** *Goodyera pubescens* is one of the orchids we found. Deer had been nibbling on nearby individuals of this patch.

**Figure 12** *Isotria medeoloides *is an orchid listed as a threatened species by the federal government. This plant is pictured fully in bloom, with its unique, small green flower.

I embody 'amateur' when it comes to identifying plant species, but I very much enjoyed the dictionary of scientific names and passion for botany that the NEBC shared with me. [Check out their website](http://www.rhodora.org/) if you’re interested in joining the fun of the NEBC and becoming more in touch with the nature of New England!  

Until next time!
