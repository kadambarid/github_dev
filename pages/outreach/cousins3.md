Artist: **Elsa Cousins**, PhD candidate in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology

I am a graduate student and an artist, exploring how to use traditional media to convey images inspired by scientific discoveries that aren't my own.

Partners: **Tobias Baskin**, Professor of Biology

Plants are everywhere. Jungles! Forests! Fields, farms, and even in the cracks of the sidewalk. Plants cover the land because they are good at growth. But neither you nor I nor anyone knows how they grow. Each plant cell is surrounded by a cell wall. Cell walls are strong, helping stems to stand up straight, roots to burrow through soil, and leaves to spread out flat and perpendicular to the light. The cell wall has to stretch to allow the cell to grow, and yet this enlargement must not be so fast as to compromise the plantâ€™s structural integrity. My laboratory measures the rates and directions at which plant cells expand and we relate those measurements to the underlying chemical and mechanical properties of the underlying cell wall. In this way, we hope at last to learn how oats, peas, beans, and barley grow.
