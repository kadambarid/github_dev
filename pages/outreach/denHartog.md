Our specimens are dead, pressed plant samples carefully mounted on acid-free archival paper, with information on when, where and by whom they were collected. They are a permanent record of what plant occupied what place at a given time in history. We have specimens dating back to 1800, and one of the first missions of U Mass when it was founded (under the name Massachusetts Agricultural College) was to care for, in perpetuity, a large collections of botanical and other natural history collections from the first half of the nineteenth Century. We have expanded continuously ever since and now have more than 260,000 specimens not including various special collections.

We assist conservation biologists in identifying rare plant species, help graduate students conduct research, and we refine our understanding of plant distributions, mostly across Massachusetts and New England.

Once one has seen enough herbarium specimens, it becomes apparent that in some cases dead plants mounted on paper can be extraordinarily beautiful. There is something about delicate structures in death and desiccation that appeals to a deeper aesthetic level than a perfect fresh flower.

We very much enjoy working with artists who may be inspired by our collection of 260,000 dead plants.
