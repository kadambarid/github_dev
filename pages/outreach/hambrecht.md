Mixed media

Partner: [Emma Dauster](http://thatslifesci.com/authors/edauster), Neuroscience and Behavior

Amy Hambrecht is a painter working across media, specifically pen, embroidery and paint, and considers a visual language that investigates the inconsistency of time through space. Hambrechtâ€™s paintings and their collage, ghost-like elements interlock in complex visual fields charged with colliding realms of the unknown and the familiar.  The artist is in her final semester as an undergraduate studio art major with a painting concentration and a minor in art history.
