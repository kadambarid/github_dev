Artist: **Skye Long**, Lecturer of Biology

Skye is not a professional artist, She is actually a lecturer in the Biology Department. Her research focuses on the relationship between sensory systems and brain morphology. This allows her the opportunity to stare at beautiful brain images for hours. In the time when normal humans are sleeping, she loves to explore her mild obsession with the natural world through many crafty and arty mediums. She hopes do one day teach spiders to express their feeling through artistic expression rather than biting.
When I first saw the Herpes virus, I was really attracted to the geometric shape of the virus and of the mRNA strands made by the host cell. This inspired me to design a mandala that shows all the actions the the infection through out the life cycle of the virus. The elements virus and host cell are identified by this different color palettes. The virus elements are in warm colors, that I associate with heat and infection. The host cell is represented by cool blues and purples, which feel calming and neutral. One of the actions of the virus is to produce enzymes that breakdown the hosts, mRNA, preventing the host from producing proteins. However, some mRNA strands are able to escape this fate. I have highlighted the possible structures and the genes that might code them with gold paint.

Kaposi’s Sarcoma Associated Herpes virus (KSHV) is a gamma-herpesvirus that establishes a lifelong biphasic infection in humans by manipulating host defenses through a variety of viral mechanisms. In the first phase, called the latent phase, the virus infiltrates the host nucleus and remain predominantly dormant. Once inside the host, the virus can use host cell pathways to sense when an environmental stress would threaten the host cell and itself. These environmental stress factors then trigger the second phase, known as the lytic phase, where the virus actively replicates its genome and remodels the host cell environment, turning it into a factor for viral particles to further spread the infection to new hosts. In the Muller lab, we study a viral remodeling mechanism called host shutoff, where KSHV cleaves the vast majority of host cell messenger RNA (mRNA), in order to favor the production of viral mRNA. It does this using its own virally encoded endonuclease, SOX. In contrast to other research efforts that investigate the host mRNA targeted by SOX for decay, we investigate the surviving RNA or escapees, those that by an as-yet to be described mechanism to escape this massive mRNA decay event . Of particular interest are the “Dominant Escapees”, escapees that contain an element was coined the SOX Resistant Element (SRE). This element protects these mRNA from degradation by SOX. Our lab’s immediate pursuit is to understand how this SRE protects these escapees from degradation from not only SOX in KSHV, but other viral endonucleases from multiple other viruses that utilize a similar strategy to usurp control of the host cell machinery during infection.
