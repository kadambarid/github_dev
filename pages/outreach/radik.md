As an origami model of transmembrane signaling by chemotaxis receptors, I was pleased to utilize modular origami techniques as well as traditional lucky stars to represent chemotaxis receptors (gray), kinase (dark blue) and a coupling proteins (cyan), with plastic poly origami "paper" for the membrane. Pun Note: Chiyogami is a style of origami paper, referring to the graphic, repetitive patterns that are inspired by kimono fabrics because the paper was originally designed for paper dolls.

Melanie Radik has been folding origami since she saw her big sister do it in grade school and wanted to try. Pyrography came a bit later- after her parents trusted her with open flame - and making art pieces of them much later. As an alumnus of the UMass Biology Department and current science librarian (Biology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Chemistry, Microbiology, and Psychological and Brain Sciences departments) the opportunity to take a closer look at some research on campus through an art lens was too good to pass up. Having recently returned to the area, exploring the changes since 2012 has been delightful and set the creative juices bubbling.

Proteins form elaborate structures that carry out critical life processes. These structures can be quite intricate and symmetric. With this collaboration I hope to share one beautiful example. Bacteria use a set of proteins to detect molecules in their surroundings and swim to a better place (such as a place with more nutrients). These proteins form a beautifully patterned array. Amazingly, this array has both segments that are very ordered into a hexagonal pattern and segments that are highly flexible. My research group and I are trying to figure out how this order and flexibility work together to let bacteria detect the environment and send the signal that controls swimming. Such understanding is important so that scientists can find ways to alter protein functions, for therapeutic purposes or other biotechnology applications.
