I am a graduate student and an artist, exploring how to use traditional media to convey images inspired by scientific discoveries that aren't my own.

I study a protein called Calcium/calmodulin dependent-protein kinase II, or CaMKII. This protein is found in the human body in a variety of tissues and organ systems including brain, heart and the reproductive system. There are four different genes that encode this protein, and not only is there a distinct variant of the protein expressed for each of the different genes, but there are variant subtypes for each gene as well, adding to the complexity of the proteins that I am biochemically characterizing. I am interested in understanding the relationship between how easily activatable the different variants are and how their activity relates to a part of the protein that varies the most between the different protein subtypes, which is a variable linker region. In the brain in particular, this protein is very important in translating calcium influxes to downstream cell signaling events in neurons, and has been shown to be important in learning and memory. By having a better understanding of the biophysical properties of this protein we hope that it can help to gain insight into a better understanding of how we encode a molecular basis of memory.
