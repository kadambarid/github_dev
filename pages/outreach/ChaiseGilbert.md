Of the roughly 70,000 species of vertebrates that we have identified, an estimated 35,000 are fishes. Fishes are wonderfully diverse, and part of their success lies within the many anatomical adaptations that have been made across the ichthyofauna. My work is centered around understanding the genetic and environmental mechanisms that drive the evolution of shape in fishes. My pursuits have been greatly aided by my love of photography, where I have found a middle ground between the sciences and arts to present anatomy as an art form. Here I present two very distinct fishes, each exhibiting drastically different morphologies. These fishes have been cleared and stained to visualize the components of their skeletal anatomy. This involves staining calcified tissues (e.g., bone) red and cartilage blue, then chemically removing cells to make the organism appear transparent. The end product can be seen in these two images. The stingray (Dasyatis sabina) is dorsoventrally compressed â€“ an adaptation that greatly aids it as is forages on the seafloor. While the lookdown (Selene vomer) is laterally compressed and can often be found navigating the coastal waters along the western Atlantic.
