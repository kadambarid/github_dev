I am a junior architecture major with minors in art and art history! I am originally from New York, where I attended school with a concentration on the arts. Through all my mediums such as watercolor, pen and ink, and digital design, I try to find ways to combine my interests in art, architecture, and sustainability. With my foundations in these areas, I am hoping to go into a field in the future geared towards preservation and the environment from a design perspective.

Partners: **Sam, Zedan, and Jedy**, PhD candidates in Plant Biology
When legumes such as soybean and peas grow, they associate with beneficial soil bacteria called rhizobia which live in special root structures called nodules (which, appear pink). These pink root nodules are essentially factories containing many hardworking rhizobia bacteria manufacturing nitrogen bio-fertilizer for the legume. This way the legume happily grows even in infertile soil. Our research goal is to understand how legumes and rhizobia form such a successful agriculturally and economically important association.
