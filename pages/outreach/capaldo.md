Artist: **Victoria Capaldo**, BFA Architecture<br>
Watercolor and ink, yupo paper

Victoria is an architecture and design studies undergraduate student at UMass Amherst. She works primarily with ink, pencil, watercolor, with a recent focus on collage and digital fabrication. Her style embraces rich color and bold graphic elements. For this exhibition, she returns to her roots as a watercolor painter in a playful and experimental series on yupo.

In the Bradley Lab, we take a spatial approach to understanding broad patterns in invasive plant introductions, spread, and impact on a landscape. In other words, we collect information about where a species exists in time and space, and use these temporal and geographic patterns to understand what influences the distribution of invasive plants. Left unchecked, invasive species are known to reduce biodiversity, alter ecosystem function, and in certain cases completely transform a landscape. For example, purple loosestrife degrades habitat for wetland birds, cheatgrass increases fire frequency in the West, and garlic mustard produces a toxin that can kill neighboring species. Many researchers study these individual species, but what can we learn when we look at invasive plants as a group? Meta-analyses, the use of aerial images from satellites, remote sensing, and mapping techniques allow us to attack this question using a broad-scale approach to understanding biological invasions.
