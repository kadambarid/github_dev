I am a junior architecture major with minors in art and art history! I am originally from New York, where I attended school with a concentration on the arts. Through all my mediums such as watercolor, pen and ink, and digital design, I try to find ways to combine my interests in art, architecture, and sustainability. With my foundations in these areas, I am hoping to go into a field in the future geared towards preservation and the environment from a design perspective.

What does an embryo need to progress through development properly? A fundamental question that remains to be answered. Embryo development involves an orchestra of many genes working together at the right time, at the right place. Sometimes, with the absence of important genes during development, embryogenesis is still able to progress because of the compensation from other genes within the same family. However, there are subsets of genes which, if absent during development, will prevent the embryo from progressing through the gestation period. My project is to characterize the mouse embryos that lack both copies of these essential genes and investigate the issues that stall these embryos from developing. Hopefully, this will help us further understand the fundamental basis for embryo development.
