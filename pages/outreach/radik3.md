I almost called this one "Mr. and Mrs. Experimental Subjects" but came up with a pun I like. Pun Note: Phonagnosia is "voice blindness," not recognizing voices of people you know. Foldagnosia. Heh.

Melanie Radik has been folding origami since she saw her big sister do it in grade school and wanted to try. Pyrography came a bit later- after her parents trusted her with open flame - and making art pieces of them much later. As an alumnus of the UMass Biology Department and current science librarian (Biology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Chemistry, Microbiology, and Psychological and Brain Sciences departments) the opportunity to take a closer look at some research on campus through an art lens was too good to pass up. Having recently returned to the area, exploring the changes since 2012 has been delightful and set the creative juices bubbling.

In our every day social relationships, we engage in back-and-forth communication that requires us to process social cues and produce appropriate responses. For example, if a stranger asks you a personal question, your response would likely be very different from if a friend asks you the same question. This means sensory areas of the brain must coordinate with social areas of the brain to produce appropriate social behaviors. I study this coordination in the brain of Zebra finches (a species of songbird), which learn complex vocalizations and use variations of these learned vocal signals across various social contexts (such as competitive or reproductive contexts). One approach I take to figure out what brain regions are important for social signal processing is to temporarily inactivate parts of the auditory brain and take measures of neural activity and gene expression in social brain regions.
