Cities are amazingly diverse places, whether it be diversity in restaurants, building heights, or plant and animal species. I study patterns of biological diversity in cities and how diversity is shaped by economics at the personal and neighborhood level. Money is power - power that allows you to buy a bird feeder or convince your city council to plant more trees on your street. But exactly how this story plays out seems to differ from city to city. My research aims to understand some of the underlying processes through which economics shape biodiversity in cities throughout the world.
