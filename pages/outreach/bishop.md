Artist: **Hannah Bishop**, MFA for Poets and Writers<br>
Poetry and digital media

Partner: Carolyn Gorss, Environmental Conservation

Hannah Bishop is an MFA poetry candidate and artist. She is originally from New Jersey. She earned her undergraduate degree from Hobart and William Smith Colleges and then worked at a gastroenterology office for a year. She greatly prefers reading poems to reading colonoscopy reports. Hannah especially enjoys sweets, RuPaul, fun facts, and her dog, Teek.
“Oxidized Rhizospheres” combines poetry and found botanical illustrations, inspired by Carolyn’s research and passion for wetlands and the flora found there.
