This origami model is called a kaleidocycle. I appreciate it in a piece about evolution because it's ever-changing. One state to the next and on forever. (The math involved in modeling evolutionary change is much more involved than what's pictured here. Much.) Pun Note: Different shapes of origami are called models. Evolutionary computer modeling.

Melanie Radik has been folding origami since she saw her big sister do it in grade school and wanted to try. Pyrography came a bit later- after her parents trusted her with open flame - and making art pieces of them much later. As an alumnus of the UMass Biology Department and current science librarian (Biology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Chemistry, Microbiology, and Psychological and Brain Sciences departments) the opportunity to take a closer look at some research on campus through an art lens was too good to pass up. Having recently returned to the area, exploring the changes since 2012 has been delightful and set the creative juices bubbling.

Partner: **Kate Bates**, PhD candidate in Neuroscience and Behavior
I am interested at the crossroads of neuroscience and evolution. I study how evolution can act on neural circuitry and behavior separately. My work is focused on the swimming behavior of sea slugs, which is ideal to study because of large easily identifiable neurons and alternating behaviors with simple electrophysiological readouts. The Katz lab previously found that the same behavior in closely related species was produced by different connectivity of circuits made of the same neurons. My current project involves using mathematical modeling to predict possible intermediate circuits that could have occurred during the course of evolutionary divergence. I use assembled circuits of Hodgkin-Huxley type biophysical neuron models to predict these intermediate states. In the future I hope to test these intermediate states by rewiring the brains of the sea slugs using dynamic clamp.
