Oil on canvas

Artist: **Emma Masse**, Bachelor of Science in Biology candidate

Emma is an undergraduate student studying biology and studio art at UMass Amherst. She works primarily with oil, watercolor, graphite, and charcoal, but is always ready to try new techniques. Much of her work is focused on the magnification of small, detailed subjects, such as food, teeth, bones, and now, fish! Emma is currently investigating the integration of art and science and exploring ways of using visual methods to represent scientific information. She is interested in physiology and evolutionary biology and plans to become a dentist.
This painting depicts a species of African Cichlid, a family of fishes known for incredible species diversity and distinctive bright coloration. A long history of trophic speciation in the Great Lakes of Africa has resulted in unique fish with dramatically different head shapes. The Albertson Lab, supporting Emmaâ€™s exploration, seeks out an understanding of the genetic and and environmental interactions taking place in the development of this craniofacial diversity. Ongoing work is based on the function of the cichlid as an evolutionary and genetic model.
