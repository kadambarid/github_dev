Partner: [Jacob Barnett](http://thatslifesci.com/authors/jbarnett), Organismic and Evolutionary Biology

As both a biologist and a visual artist, the intersection between the two fields has been a point of focus in Rachel’s artwork for many years. Biological discoveries throughout the past several centuries were inherently shaped by the artistic methods used to depict and communicate these findings. Scientific discoveries of organismic form and function became art through the careful depictions of natural historians. This art was publically engaging and far reaching in its impact on Western aesthetics. Rachel’s body of artistic work is in conversation with the past and current relationship between natural history and art history. While she is a published scientific illustrator and has a large body of traditional naturalist artwork, she greatly enjoys using surrealist and humorous elements to build complex visual narratives about the organisms she is depicting.
