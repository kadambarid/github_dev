(Ecological) interactions can shape landscapes and shuffle communities of organisms. They can dictate how populations change over time. These interactions could be between individuals of the same, similar, or very different species. They can be direct or indirect. Competition and predation are well-known examples of biological interactions. One of the most fascinating interactions (at least to me!) is that involving organisms living in what's known as a 'landscape of fear' (quite poetic, I agree). It has been proposed that, arguably, herbivores and smaller carnivores live in 'fear' of the top predator, and just this fear could have impacts on their behavior and populations, which in turn could trickle down and influence other aspects of the landscape. This implies that even an indirect interaction, such as the mere presence of an organism, could affect aspects of other organisms, communities, entire ecosystems even. And that, to me, is incredible! To be able to study these scientifically - document, observe, experiment - in the wild, and inform conservation where appropriate, is rewarding and gratifying.
