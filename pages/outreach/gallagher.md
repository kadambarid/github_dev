My name is Sam Gallagher and I'm a sophomore architecture major! I'm originally from New York City, and studied the arts in school while I lived there. The mediums I tend to work with in my art include watercolor, pen and ink, graphite, and clay, and I primarily focus on patterns, abstract designs, and portraiture.

With my architecture foundations in college, I hope to go into sustainable architecture and design. I care immensely about the environment and preservation, and want to help drive the architecture industry towards more green design and resilience. When I'm not in studio, I'm involved in the UMass Green Building Council and the Green Roof Club, and I enjoy hiking, painting, baking, or eating at Frank.
