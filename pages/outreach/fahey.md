Watercolor, ink, charcoal

Partner: [Abby Vander Linden](http://thatslifesci.com/authors/avlinden), Organismic and Evolutionary Biology

Eva Lin Fahey primarily works in water-based media to create abstracted, dream-like spaces. These spaces explore the interconnections between family, cultural hybridity, and identity. An adoptee from China, Eva is currently creating work that investigates her complicated connections to both American and Chinese culture.  Much of her work revolves around the ideas of attachment and detachment, connection and divide.
