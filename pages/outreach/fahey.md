Eva Lin Fahey primarily works in water-based media to create abstracted, dream-like spaces. These spaces explore the interconnections between family, cultural hybridity, and identity. An adoptee from China, Eva is currently creating work that investigates her complicated connections to both American and Chinese culture.  Much of her work revolves around the ideas of attachment and detachment, connection and divide.

During the mating season, male bighorn sheep slam into each other head-first at up to 20 miles per hour, over and over, for hours on end. The winner gets to mate; the loser gets nothing. They have huge protective horns to shield their skulls from these clashesâ€”but how do they avoid breaking their necks during impact? I study how the shape of the neck vertebrae have evolved in bighorn sheep and many other related animals such as deer, moose, antelope, goats, and bison. My research aims to discover whether species that fight with their horns or antlers have adaptations in the neck to help them resist dangerous forces generated by ramming, stabbing, fencing, or shoving in the battle to win mating rights. I use a combination of morphometric measurements taken from museum specimens and 3D models created from CT scans to quantify the shape of these bones across species and test how the different shapes respond to potential fighting forces.
